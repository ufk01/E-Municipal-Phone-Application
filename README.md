# E-Municipal-Phone-Application
--Personal Project--
It is a municipal phone application. There are various features. For example: Newsletter, bus times, online payment etc. But I did the UI design part for a temporary period just to make it look good to the eye. In addition, online payment, settings, notifications are still being developed. Zip files contain only Java code and XML files. Because the whole file was too big.
